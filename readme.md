# Projector Corrector for Figma and Google Chrome

Adjusting to an external display is not an impossible task, but plugging your laptop into a projector 10 seconds before showing your work to execs and seeing a washed out mess is a designer's nightmare. Don't fiddle with TV or projector menus. Instead use Projector Corrector for Chrome to quickly improve the contrast of your tab content.

> Do you design with Figma? Use the web app and this extension when presenting!

## Usage

Toggle the overlay with the top <kbd> </kbd> button. This covers your web content with a 10% alpha black overlay to improve contrast on blown out external presentation devices. Need it darker or lighter? Use the <kbd>+</kbd> or <kbd>-</kbd> buttons to adjust the opacity of the overlay.
